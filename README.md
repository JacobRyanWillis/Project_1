# Your Digital Personal Trainer

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn how to effectively work together with a group to accomplish the same goal. Our developers were each given their own section to work on, and they did wonderful! We ran into some merging and branch issues but learned how to effectively use these branches. <br>

We successfully created a web application that focuses on Fitness and Nutrition utilizing our personalized Digital Personal Trainer. Go For Fitness is easy to navigate and simplistic to utilize as we have mastered the use of Bulma for stlying, as well as Jquery, which makes it extremely easy to use Javascript on our webpage. The functions and features implemented, allow for the user to select customized workouts targeting specific muscle groups, as well as selecting specialized nutrition plans according to the user's diet plans and nutrition needs. We strategically integrated the option for the user to store their favorite workouts and recipes for easier access each time they visit the site. As a group, we learned the importance of communication as it pertains to keeping one another on the same page in order to reduce conflicts in our HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
